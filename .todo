config/* tests:
==============

We need to verify that the configs that go into configs/ are:

 a) syntactically good json (or python, eventually).
 b) present a well-formed config
 c) are acceptable for the script(s) they're designed for (this will require
    more info, like a config dtd equivalent, for what's optional and what's
    required and what format they will be.)

Cross-platform tests
====================

I'm developing on OSX and running pretty much on linux.
I want mozharness to be usable on Windows, however.

That doesn't mean that every single script needs to be runnable on Windows;
linux- or osx- specific scripts can be as platform-specific as they want
to be.

What I want x-platform tests for is lib/base/* and anything else where we
want to support Windows.
