config/* tests:
==============

We need to verify that the configs that go into configs/ are:

 a) syntactically good json (or python, eventually).
 b) present a well-formed config
 c) are acceptable for the script(s) they're designed for (this will require
    more info, like a config dtd equivalent, for what's optional and what's
    required and what format they will be.)
